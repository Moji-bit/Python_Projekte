# this is a calculator python program that performs basic arithmetic operations
# such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and exponentiation.
# The program displays a menu of operations for the user to choose from.
# The user can select an operation by entering a number from 0 to 6.
# The program then asks for the necessary inputs and performs the operation.
# The result and the execution time of the operation are displayed.
# The calculator runs continuously unless the user chooses to exit by selecting 0.


# import the needed modules
import time  # to measure the execution time of operations 
import math  # to perform mathematical operations

# Function to display the menu
